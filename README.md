# Electron Game Template

This project is intended to bootstrap a new game project with Electron.  It sets up the main window, sets the background to black and adds a centred blank canvas object that scales with the window height (width of the element will be the same as the height).

I used this template to build my game submission for the LowRezJam 2022 game jam on itch.io and found it to be a good foundation so I wanted to make a repository of this starting point to get future projects off the ground quickly.
